			<h2><div class="colors">Delhi Tourism</div></h2>
				<p>The capital of India, Delhi is a cosmopolitan city with a historic old Delhi and the modern New Delhi. From historical monuments to crowded shopping malls, from an extensive network of the modern metro system to Delhi University campus, Dilli has multiple personalities and is considered to be the city with a heart.

The narrow, winding lanes and bylanes of old Delhi are a testament to the former Mughal rule. Old Delhi houses one of the country's oldest and busiest market – Chandni Chowk.

Take time to explore historical monuments such as the Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Humayun's Tomb and Purana Qila if you want to explore the Mughal History. Delhi has famous temples scattered all across the city, a few noteworthy ones being the Akshardham Temple, the Lotus Temple (also known as the Bahai Temple), and the ISKON Temple.

Central Delhi is the concentration of the country's political power, and the must-visit places here include the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Raisina Hill, the Rajpath, and the India Gate. The best place to visit this area is in the evening, as all the buildings are lit up, and you can see the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate shining brightly.

People in Delhi love to eat, and tourists will find themselves spoilt for choice between the multitude of dishes on offer at every corner of every street. From kebabs and tikkas to Chhole Bhature, Delhi is a melting pot of diverse cultures, and this fact is reflected in the culinary palette of the city.

Delhi is a shopper's paradise with some colourful bazaars and upscale markets. The wide variety of markets in Delhi ensure that travellers go back home with double the luggage they came with!</p>
