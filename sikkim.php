			<h2><div class="colors">Sikkim Tourism </div></h2>
				<p>Sikkim, located in the north-eastern region of India, is a small state with a big heart. Travelling across this Himalayan state is particularly highlighted by the dramatic contouring of the scenery from thick woodlands to colourful meadows to few barren patches to the panoramic views of the snowcapped mountains. Occupied by warm-hearted people offering some of the best hospitality and boasting of magnificent treks, snow activities and scenic views, Sikkim is truly a destination people fall in love with!

The third highest peak in the world and jewel of the state, Kanchenjunga is visible from almost anywhere you stand. Characterised by freezing winters and cool summers, the state plays host to a large number of tourists all year round. Until 1975, when it was merged with India, Sikkim functioned as an autonomous kingdom with its own monarchy. Since then, it has become an integral part of India with a distinctive culture which has evolved into a multifaceted one. Influenced by the peaceful coexistence of the dominant Nepalese community with the native Bhutias and the immigrant Lepchas, one will find many monasteries and Hindu shrines in close proximity to each other.

Accessible mainly via road from the neighbouring states, the newly inaugurated Pakyong airport near the capital city of Gangtok highlights government efforts towards better connectivity. Regarded primarily as a peaceful hilly escape during the harsh Indian summers, Sikkim?s abundance of natural beauty is arguably second to none compared to anywhere else in India.
